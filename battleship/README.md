# Battleship
The goal of the battleship assignment is to find all of the ships on a grid in as few guesses as possible. 

## Compiling/Running
### Vagrant

### Windows
- [CMake For Visual Studio Documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/build/cmake-projects-in-visual-studio?view=msvc-170) Install Visual Studio 2022, Cmake Tools and C++ Tools on your home computer

## Rules
The board is 1000x1000 with 5 ships

you must implement `src/user_solver.cpp`
``` c++
void UserSolver::solve(Board &board)
{
  //Your Implementation goes here
  ReturnType t = guess(1, 1, board);
}
```

An example implementation is in `src/example_solver.cpp`

``` c++
void ExampleSolver::solve(Board &board) {
  for (int i = 0; i < board.getX(); i++) {
    for (int j = 0; j < board.getY(); j++) {
        guess(i, j, board);
    }
  }
}
```

The `Solver` class exposes a function called `guess` that takes in 3 arguments. an `X` coordinate, a `Y` coordinate and the board to look up the coordinates. It returns a `ResultType`. There are 4 possible values for the `ResultType` enum: `Hit`, `Miss`, `Near Miss`, and `Bad Guess`. They signify
- Miss is returned when the cell at x,y is empty and no adjacent cell has a value
- Near Miss is returned when the cell at x,y is empty but an adjacent cell has a value
- Hit is returned when the cell at x,y has a value
- Bad Guess is returned when the x,y coordinates are out of range

using these return values you must devise an algorithm to find the 5 ships in fewer moves than the computer (see example)


### Running Tests
in the root of the battleship project run:
``` shell
my_project$ cd build && ctest
```

the output looks something like 
``` shell
Test project /home/karl/src/cpp_one_assignments/battleship/build
    Start 1: SOLVER_TEST.BasicAssertions
1/1 Test #1: SOLVER_TEST.BasicAssertions ......   Passed    0.04 sec

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 1
```
